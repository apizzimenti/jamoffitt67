## Julia A. Moffitt, PhD
**Physiologist, Data Scientist**

The following portfolio includes a compilation of research projects I've conducted, written and published as a physiologist and several recent data science projects I've completed.  I am currently blending these two areas of experience and interest in a project investigating the analysis of pacing behavior in ultramarathon runners.   Ongoing research efforts in Heart Rate Variability analysis in humans is continuing as well.  A link to my full-length CV is provided below.  Feel free to explore links for examples of my work in all these areas.
